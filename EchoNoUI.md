This is my protoype design for a hands-free ("No UI") totally audio interface 
to interacting with applications running in the Salesforce cloud.

* Domains of data / objects / classes
* Dialogs / user stories / use cases
* Intents
* Re-prompt

## <a name="Domains"> Domains of Data / Objects / Classes</a>

* Apps to use
* Contacts (to contact via phone, Chatter, email, SMS, send letter, Tweet) noted in the Profile of each contact
* Groups of contacts

* Tweet to send
* Facebook blog to create
* Wordpress blog entry to create

* Accounts (Companies)
* Opportunities
* Cases for action associated with accounts
* Projects organizing cases
* Boards in Trello which organize tasks
* Events in Calendar
* Subject of Tasks (To-Do list) to follow-up on leads, etc.
* Dates in Calendar (Today, Tomorrow, etc.)
* Ideas

* Feeds, Reports to view
* Websites to read

* Solutions
* Product descriptions
* Features of each product 
* Units of measure (pounds, feet, etc.)
* Inventory of product items
* Location of products with available inventory

* Campaigns
* Sales Orders to a customer
