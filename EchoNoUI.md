This is my protoype design for a hands-free ("No UI") totally audio interface 
to interacting with applications running in the Salesforce cloud.

* Domains of data / objects / classes
* Dialogs / user stories / use cases
* Intents
* Re-prompt

## <a name="Domains"> Domains of Data / Objects / Classes</a>

* Apps to use
* Contacts (to contact via phone, Chatter, email, SMS, send letter) noted in the Profile of each contact
* Tweet
* Facebook blog
* Wordpress blog
* Accounts (Companies)
* Cases for action associated with accounts
* Projects organizing cases
* Boards in Trello which organize tasks
* Events in Calendar
* Tasks (To-Do list) to follow-up on leads, etc.

* Reports to view
* Websites to read

* Product descriptions
* Units of measure (pounds, feet, etc.)
* Inventory of product items
* Location of products with available inventory

* Sales Orders to a customer
* Deliveries en route (via UPS / FedEx, etc.)
