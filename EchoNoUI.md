This is my protoype design for a hands-free ("No UI") totally audio interface 
to interacting with applications running in the Salesforce cloud.

* Domains of data / objects / classes
* Dialogs / user stories / use cases
* Intents
* Re-prompt

## <a name="Domains"> Domains of Data / Objects / Classes</a>

* Contacts (to contact via phone, Chatter, email) noted in the Profile of each contact
* Apps
* Accounts (Companies)
* Projects
* Product descriptions
* Inventory of product items
* Cases for action = Tasks (To-Do list)
* Reports to view
