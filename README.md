Before we get started, note that Salesforce as a company has several offerings (all SaaS in the cloud):

  * Salesforce.com CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is categorized as a SaaS (Software as a Service)
    offering a complete package much like what Google Apps (Gmail), Zoho, and Quickbooks Online provides.
  * FinancialForce.com is also a SaaS providing software for managing financial information.

  * Force.com runs underneath SaaS, and is categorized as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) service
    which generalizes the coding in CRM for use in other user domains

  * Heroku.com provides free hosting for low-volume apps written in open-source programming.

1) Read the whitepaper in http://developer.Force.com

2) See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKA3cJmoms "Multi Tenant Magic" ([45] 17 Nov 2014)
   in the Salesforce Developers YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKORm8sxh3cheBpqs0akkhg 

Technologically:

  * The Apex object-oriented programming language managing classes and triggers defined in a database.
  * The Visualforce tag-based web development language managing pages and components.
  * See them both in the Schema Browser

  * SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
  * Chattr instant-message

## <a name="LaborDemand"> Labor Demand</a>
Strong and growing.
  * Growth rate 35% year-over-year

I think Salesforce is hands-down the easiest and fastest way to create apps.

  * Free development environment (no 7 day trials)
  * Integrations
  *  Free, full-featured copy of the Salesforce1 Platform
  * Develop apps with clicks or code
  * Fine-grained access control 
  * highly scalable
  * API-first to integrate anything with everything
  * Use popular UI frameworks like Bootstrap, JQuery and more 
  
## <a name="SkillCerts"> Skill Certification</a>
There are two technical jobs:
  * Administrators
  * Developers (which includes database)

https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead provides

## <a name="ChangeMgmt"> Change Management</a>
Three releases are planned per year, with beta releases of Minimally Marketable Features (MMF).
So certification holders must take tests.

## <a name="PluralsightTutorials"> MetaData</a>
An <strong>Org</strong> is a container for metadata that drives the dynamic engine (kernel).

## <a name="UI"> Force.com Architectural Stack</a>
Layers:

  * View layer for UI
  * Controller / APIs (for external programmatic access)
  * Application Lobic
  * Database
  * Infrastructure

## <a name="UI"> Salesforce UI</a>
The Salesforce console can seem overwhelming at first.
