Before we get started, note that Salesforce as a company has several offerings (all SaaS in the cloud):

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.Salesforce.com/">Salesforce.com</a>
    CRM (Customer Relationship Management) -- the company's stock market symbol --
    is categorized as a SaaS (Software as a Service)
    offering a complete package much like what Google Apps (Gmail), Zoho, and Quickbooks Online provides
    in a "multi-tenant" environment which serves many customers (tenants) on the same hardware.
    Salesforce also includes project management.

    http://www.salesforce.com/platform/overview/

  * <strong>ExactTarget</strong> Fuel Marketing Cloud emails to target specific prospects.
  
  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.financialforce.com/">FinancialForce.com</a>
    is also a SaaS providing software for managing financial information.

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.Force.com/"> Force.com</a> 
    runs underneath SaaS, and is categorized as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) service
    which generalizes the coding in CRM for use in other user domains

    https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.fundamentals.meta/fundamentals/

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.Heroku.com/">Heroku.com</a>
    provides free hosting for low-volume apps written in open-source programming.

  * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.database.com/">Database.com</a>

## <a name="LaborDemand"> Labor Demand</a>
Strong and growing.
  * Growth rate 35% year-over-year
  * Salesforce has not been profitable, but its market value (stock price x shares) is $48 billion dollars.
  * Microsoft's $50 billion offer was rejected.
  * The prediction is for a buyout from Oracle, where Salesforce CEO Benoitt had worked.

Salesforce and Force.com are more attractive to mid-market customers than SAP and Oracle.
So you're not as much forced to work for large consulting firms living out of hotels.

Salesforce, as a company, pioneered the 1:1:1 model, which donates one percent of our time, equity, and product to non-profit organizations via http://www.salesforcefoundation.org/

Use case:

* Reliance on spreadsheets
* Collaboration via email
* Documents shared on local file directories
* Time-intensive, manual steps 

Technologically:

  * The <strong>declarative</strong> aspects of the platform is why the company's main number  is 800.NO-SOFTWARE.
  
    It has CRUD style security permissions model. Learn this first.
  
  * The <strong>Apex</strong> (Java-like) object-oriented programming language
    managing classes and triggers defined in a database.
    This includes Apex Email services and Call-Outs and Apex (SOAP & REST API) web services

I think Salesforce provides an easy and fast way to create apps.

  * Free development environment (no 7 day trials)
  * Integrations
  *  Free, full-featured copy of the Salesforce1 Platform
  * Develop apps with clicks or code
  * Fine-grained access control 
  * highly scalable
  * API-first to integrate anything with everything
  * Use popular UI frameworks like Bootstrap, JQuery and more

Salesforce was launched in 2000, with SOAP API (web service) added 2004.
The Salesforce1 brand name appeared in 2014.

Three releases are planned per year, named by season such as <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/events/webinars/Summer_15_Release_Preview?d=70130000000NJR1">
"Summer 2015"</a>,
applied gradually to 8,000 customers each

Salesforce reportedly has 55,000 enterprise customers, 1.5 million individual subscribers, 30 million lines of third-party code,
 
(Running on 1,000 machines, half of which are for redundancy. )[http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/the-efficient-cloud-all-of-salesforce-runs-on-only-1000-servers/]

4 copies of each Oracle RAC database Array is maintained via real-time async replication across 2 instances: 
2 on-line and 2 off-line.

http://www.trust.salesforce.com/
provides real-time information on system availability, performance history, and security alerts.

Metadata literally means data about data. Read https://developer.salesforce.com/page/An_Introduction_to_Force.com_Metadata

A Salesforce <strong>Org</strong> (short for organization) is a 
<strong>container</strong> for metadata that drives the dynamic engine (kernel).

Salesforce’s secret sauce: It queries its databases with “The Multi-Tenant Optimizer.”

## <a name="PlatformArch"> Platform Architecture</a>
SOAP API is mainly for metadata (not business data).

The REST API returning JSON or XML uses "hypermedia" design.

The "BULK" REST API for large datasets (of 50 million rows)
of XML and CSV (rather than JSON) format.

The Streaming API is a publish/subscribe push model to notify changes to object data.
It uses Bayeux Protocol and CometD libraries
used mainly in social networking apps.

It doesn't have ORM (but seems to be there).

OrgID hashed to one of 32 keys used to distribute.
Smart Primary Keys and Polymorphic Foreign Keys.
Creative de-normalization and pivoting.

When you delete a custom object, Salesforce does not add it to the Recycle Bin. Instead, deleted objects appear in the Deleted Objects list for 15 days. During this time, the object and its data are soft deleted, meaning you can restore or permanently erase (hard delete) the object and its data. After 15 days, the object and its data are automatically hard deleted.

Soft-deleted custom objects and their data count against your organization’s limits; hard-deleted items do not.

See them in the Schema Browser.
